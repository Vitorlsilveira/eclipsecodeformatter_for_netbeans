Eclipse Java Code Formatter for NetBeans
========================================

This NetBeans plugin helps you to apply to a common code style in a team of Eclipse JDT and NetBeans IDE users. The original formatting engine of Eclipse is embedded and allows you to format the sourcecode the same way as your Eclipse co-workers do. You only have to provide a Eclipse formatter configuration file.
